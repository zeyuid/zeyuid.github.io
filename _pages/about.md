I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Control Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University, China, supervised by Prof. [Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jmchen) and Prof. [Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp). I was a visiting student at CISPA âˆ’ Helmholtz Center for Information Security during 10.2019 -- 03.2020, supervised by Prof. [Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and Dr. [Yang Zhang](https://cispa.saarland/people/yang.zhang/).
I obtained my B.S. degree (with honors) from East China University of Science and Technology. 


I am working on security of industrial control systems (ICSs), from both aspects of system data and execution binaries. I am also interested in structure learning, privacy preserving machine learning. 
<!-- especially understanding the role of invariants in ICSs.  -->

Research Interests
======
Cyber physical system security;\\
<!-- Structure learning;\\ -->
State estimation in LTI system;\\
Privacy-preserving machine learning
