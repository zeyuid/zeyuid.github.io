I'm currently a research assistant in Zhejiang University. 
Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D candidate in Control Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University, China, supervised by Prof. [Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jmchen) and Prof. [Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp). I was a visiting student at CISPA âˆ’ Helmholtz Center for Information Security during 10.2019 -- 03.2020, supervised by Prof. [Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and Dr. [Yang Zhang](https://cispa.saarland/people/yang.zhang/).
I obtained my B.S. degree (with honors) from East China University of Science and Technology. 


I am working on the security of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs), including the Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), from both the process physics and control program.
