I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Control Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University, China, supervised by Prof. [Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jmchen) and Prof. [Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp). I am a visiting student at CISPA âˆ’ Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany, supervised by Prof. [Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and Dr. [Yang Zhang](https://cispa.saarland/people/yang.zhang/). 
I obtained my B.S. degree (with honors) from East China University of Science and Technology. 


I am working on security of industrial control systems (ICSs), from both aspects of system data and physical model. I am also interested in structure learning, especially understanding the role of invariants in ICSs. 

Research Interests
