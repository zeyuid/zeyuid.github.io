I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University. I obtained my B.S. degree (with honors) in East China University of Science and Technology. 

I am working on security of industrial control systems, from both aspects of system data and physical model. I am also interested in structure learning, especially understanding the role of control invariants of system controller.
