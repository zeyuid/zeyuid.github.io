I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Control Science and Engineering of Zhejiang University. I obtained my B.S. degree (with honors) from East China University of Science and Technology. 

I am working on security of industrial control systems (ICSs), from both aspects of system data and physical model. I am also interested in structure learning, especially understanding the role of invariants in ICSs. 

Research Interests
======
Cyber physical system security;\\
Structure learning;\\
State estimation in LTI system.\\
