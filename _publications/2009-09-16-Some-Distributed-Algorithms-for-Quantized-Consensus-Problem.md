Abstract: 
===
In this paper, we propose some distributed algorithms for quantized consensus. These algorithms are used to study the distributed averaging problem on arbitrary connected graphs and arbitrary connected weighted graphs, with the additional constraint that the weight value at each node is an integer. These algorithms can guarantee the system achieve consensus with some moderate assumptions and can use to solve several application problems, such as averaging in a network with finite capacity channels and load balancing in a processor network, which can be modeled as distributed averaging problem.
